Bluetooth Controlled Home Automation System
________________________________________
Introduction
This project demonstrates a Bluetooth Controlled Home Automation System that allows wireless switching of household electrical appliances using a smartphone. The system is designed to be cost-effective, reliable, and user-friendly, and is suitable for short-range domestic automation tasks. It employs an Arduino Uno microcontroller, HC-05 Bluetooth module, relays, transistors, flyback diodes, and manual push buttons. The control interface is created using MIT App Inventor, which allows the user to control appliances through both button clicks and voice commands via Bluetooth communication.

Components Used
1.	Arduino Uno: Acts as the central controller that processes Bluetooth input and toggles outputs.
2.	HC-05 Bluetooth Module: Facilitates wireless communication between the Arduino and the smartphone.
3.	Relay Module (2 SPDT Relays): Switches AC appliances on or off.
4.	NPN Transistors (2N2222): Amplify Arduino's output current to drive the relays.
5.	Flyback Diodes (1N4007): Protect components from back EMF generated by relay coils.
6.	Resistors (1kΩ): Limit current to transistor bases.
7.	Push Buttons: Provide manual control of appliances.
8.	AC Lamps and DC Motor: Represent the appliances being controlled.
9.	Power Supply: 5V for Arduino, 12V for relays and DC motor, 230V AC for lamps.

Circuit Explanation
The Arduino Uno receives serial commands via the HC-05 Bluetooth module. Upon receiving a specific character, it outputs a HIGH signal on the corresponding digital pin. This signal is passed through a 1kΩ resistor to the base of a 2N2222 transistor, allowing it to conduct and energize the relay coil.
When energized, the relay switches its terminal from Normally Closed (NC) to Normally Open (NO), enabling the appliance to operate. Turning off the relay reverts the connection, stopping the appliance.
Flyback diodes are connected in reverse bias across the relay coils to suppress voltage spikes and protect sensitive components. Manual push buttons are also connected to the Arduino's digital input pins. When pressed, they send a signal to toggle the state of the respective relay, ensuring the system can function even if Bluetooth connectivity fails.

Software and Simulation
1.	MIT App Inventor: Used to design a smartphone app that sends commands to the HC-05 module via Bluetooth. The app supports both button-based and voice-based control.
2.	Proteus 8 Professional: Used to simulate the entire circuit. External libraries for Arduino Uno and HC-05 were imported. Proteus enabled visualization of relay switching, transistor behavior, and communication flow, validating the system before physical implementation.

Challenges Faced
1.	Relay Triggering Errors: Inconsistent switching due to improper biasing was fixed by adjusting resistor values.
2.	Back EMF Issues: Relay coil switching caused voltage spikes, damaging components. This was resolved by adding flyback diodes.
